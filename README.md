ZionistFree is a repository with collection of tools and snippets you can add to block Israelis from accessing your webpages, webservers, e-commerce stores, and helps you enable Palestine fully on WordPress.

For MacOS, LittleSnitch is one of the most famous firewalls and creating a rule with denying any type of connection out of these IP addresses will block 8,8 million IPs from Israel.

ℹ️ These are not all IP addresses, however, it's plenty for you to block all peer-to-peer sharing and such. [Use this IP address list here](https://github.com/Radio-Yugoslavia/ZionistFree/blob/main/israel-ip-address-list), feel free to update if you can gather more data please.
